linux-sys-programs
==================

A collection of linux system programming methods from "Advanced Linux Programming Book"


This repository is to keep track of my learning experiance. I named the sources files very crearly 
to make it easy to understand what does it contains. In the same time this will be helpful to know
the advanced C programming concepts.

I added lot of comments on each C/C++ source files, so it would be very easy to follow the concepts of how the Linux
System works and we can use these methodologies for future system programming works.
